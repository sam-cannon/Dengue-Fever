# Dengue-Fever
This is my code from the DengueAI DrivenData competition where I scored in the top 25% with a simple regression approach.
This competition helped me with understanding the basics of stacking algorithms more as well as imputing for missing values based 
on the values of other features. If anyone has any questions about this code please let me know at fultoncannon@gmail.com
