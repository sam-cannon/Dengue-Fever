# Dengue-Fever
This is my code from the DengueAI DrivenData competition where I scored in the top 25% with a simple regression approach.
This competition helped me with understanding the basics of stacking algorithms more as well as imputing for missing values based 
on the values of other features. An interesting note about my process during this competition: I began looking at this problem as a 
potential regression and classification problem and was able to achieve a reasonably good score with classification algorithms. However, after submitting several attempts it became clear that regression was the way to go here. I thought it was interesting though how one could treat this issue with both approaches and get decent results...
If anyone has any questions about this code please let me know at fultoncannon@gmail.com
